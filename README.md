# Vim Visual Cheat Sheet

Take visual notes of how I use Vim so far. It is interesting to see how Vim takes up the whole keyboard (actually there are too much to put on the graphs). Most of them are Vim's default, except some customization I put gray notes on them.

The **weird** keyboard remapping is inspired by [Terminal ADM-3A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_Terminal_ADM3A.svg), the original keyboard Vi was designed for, and [Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2](http://www.pfu.fujitsu.com/hhkeyboard/hhkbpro2/spec.html).

For my Vim configuration see [tanyuan/vim-config](https://github.com/tanyuan/vim-config).
